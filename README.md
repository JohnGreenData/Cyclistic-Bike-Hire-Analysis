Cyclistic Bike Hire Analysis  
Converting casual riders into annual members using data

Project overview  
This project addresses the challenge of converting casual bike hire users into annual members. By analysing usage patterns across rider types, time periods, and bike types, I developed data-driven recommendations to support long-term revenue growth.

Business problem  
Cyclistic wanted to understand how casual riders differ from annual members, and how those insights could be used to increase membership conversions without negatively impacting existing casual rider revenue.

Approach
 - Cleaned and analysed over 5 million bike hire records.
 - Segmented behaviour by customer type, day of week, month, ride length, and bike type.
 - Identified seasonal patterns, behavioural differences, and notable anomalies.
 - Developed and evaluated a targeted promotional strategy based on observed behaviour.

Key insights
 - Members take more frequent, shorter rides, mainly during weekdays.
 - Casual riders take longer rides and generate significant revenue, particularly at weekends.
 - Seasonal effects strongly influence casual usage, with anomalies in February and October.

Recommendations
 - Introduce a temporary weekday-focused discount to encourage “member-like” usage.
 - Roll out promotions gradually and monitor closely to protect casual revenue.
 - Retain weekend pricing to avoid eroding high-value leisure usage.

Tools and technologies  
SQL (Google BigQuery), Tableau, Excel.

Outputs  
A full stakeholder report, including supporting visualisations, SQL code, and aggregated data CSV files are included in this repository.  The raw original data can be found at the below link, as it is too big for GitHub:
